### Open Minyan Project

Open Minyan project is a free Minyan contact list project. It allows any possible shul congregation to access a list of possible congregants to recruit for a minyan or similar activity. Those shuls can only view the members in that state, making it possible for them to find people.
It also has a strict Do Not Call list, with members that have registered to NOT be called for these events. The user can change their state and call preferences at any time by going to the dashboard. 
More features coming soon.
To join as a shul, go to minyanlist.netlify.app/pricing to get a list for free.
To join as user, go to minyanlist.netlify.app
